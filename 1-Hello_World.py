#This is the very first LESSON of every programmer

#Command the computer to print out Hello World
print("Hello WOrld")
#Unlike other programming language, Python does not require semi-colon ";" at the end of every command 

#The pound "#" sign at the beginning of every line indicates a comment command
#The Ide will not read the comment line, these are notes for the programmers to read
#THIS LINE IS A COMMENT AND WILL NOT BE READ
